# **Spaceship Titanic Machine Learning Project**
This project illustrates the steps necessary to develop a machine learning algorithm and evaluate it on unseen data. 

## Summary
The data and objective of this project are from the Kaggle competition [*Spaceship Titanic*](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spaceship-titanic). Given an identifier column (*PassengerId*), a set of 12 fields (that contain character, Boolean, and numerical data), and a Boolean target variable (*Transported*) for roughly 8700 passengers (training data), the task is to develop a machine learning algorithm that accurately predicts whether about 4300 other passengers (test data) on the spaceship titanic were transported to another dimension following a space collision. The project encompasses all the tasks necessary to design a successful model: data cleaning and exploration, imputation of missing values, feature engineering, and model tuning, selection, and evaluation.
